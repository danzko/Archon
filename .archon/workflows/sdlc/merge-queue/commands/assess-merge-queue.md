# Assess a merge batch

Requested PR URLs: $INPUTS.prs
Additional evidence: $INPUTS.evidence
Keep the checkout unchanged; the only GitHub write here is the hold comment
described below. Read project guidance and use gh with an explicit repository. Require 1-5 distinct same-repository PRs targeting one base.
Reject ambiguous identity, forks, drafts, closed PRs, conflicts, unknown checks,
or unresolved review findings. Read PR bodies, review comments, status checks and
required CI for the current head; pending is not passing. Require independent
review and actual validation evidence, including project-required runtime checks.
No checks is not evidence of validation. Read the supplied reports in full and
verify their source/head matches; a prose assertion that tests passed is insufficient.

The final merge gate supplies two fresh, vendor-distinct reviews after this
assessment. Existing canonical review reports remain useful evidence here, but do
not treat either gate-owned status context (`factory/review-anthropic` or
`factory/review-zai`) as independent validation: the final script publishes them
only after it verifies the reviewer events. All other required checks, including
`factory/runtime`, must already be present and passing; missing or unknown checks
hold the batch.

Read dependencies and diffs to select an order. Hold if the requested PRs have an
unresolved dependency or incompatible changes; do not silently add PRs to the batch.
Write merge-plan.json under $ARTIFACTS_DIR with repository, base, base_sha,
ordered PR number/url/head_sha entries, evidence references and reasons. `base_sha`
is the base branch's live head as read from GitHub during this assessment
(`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/<base> --jq .commit.sha`), not a PR's
merge base and not a PR record's `base.sha`, which is a snapshot: the merge node
compares the live head against it to detect movement between assessment and
merge. If a PR's validation predates the live base
head, judge that here (GitHub's mergeability and the checks on the current PR head)
rather than recording the older base. Record holds in merge-plan.md. Return ready only when the entire requested batch is
eligible. No code changes, branch switches, custom worktrees, or agent subprocesses.

A hold recorded only under this run's artifacts is a hold nobody sees, and in an
unattended factory the PR then sits open forever. When a PR is held for a reason
its own next commit can fix — an acceptance criterion or runtime contract the diff
does not meet, a canonical review that is missing, not ready, or stale, a conflict
with its base — publish the hold on that PR as one issue comment whose first line
is `<!-- archon-merge-hold -->`, naming the head SHA assessed and each reason with
the evidence that proves it (the criterion quoted, the code that misses it). Search
the PR's comments for that marker first and edit the existing comment in place;
never append a second. When a PR carrying the marker is now eligible, edit the
comment to say the hold cleared at the new head. A transient hold — checks still
pending, the base moved — is not published; a later run resolves it without a code
change. The shared review workflow reads this comment when a delivery is re-driven
on the branch, which is how the hold becomes a finding that gets fixed.
